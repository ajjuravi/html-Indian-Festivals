The Rakhi Festival symbolizes all aspects of protection of the good from evil forces. Rakhi is meant to sweeten the ties of brother and sister. Rakhi is celebrated with great joy and excitement all around India. Known as Raksha Bandhan in other parts of the country, Rakhi festival showcases the love, affection and feeling of brotherhood. Raksha Bandhan usually falls in late August. The main ritual consists of tying the 'Rakhi' knot on to a brother's wrist. 'Raksha Bandhan' literally means 'Bond of protection' and implies that while the sister prays to God for the well-being and prosperity of her brother, the brother vows to protect her against all the evils of the world and help her in all the problems. The day is all about Raksha or protection. The values, emotions and the sentiments attached to the customs of Rakhi festival are worth inculcating by the whole human race, the sentiments of harmony and peaceful coexistence.

Rakhi is celebrated with great excitement and joy across India and other parts of the worlds where Indians reside. From early morning everybody starts getting ready for the occasion. On the day of Rakshabandhan, people generally prefer to wear traditional attires. Men mostly wear kurta pyjama on this occasion whereas women prefer to wear sari or salwar suits, which are mainly Indian traditional clothes. People generally prefer to wear cotton material cloths, as this is comfortable during this season. But with the changing fashion trends every year, people generally tend to follow the fashion of that season during the festival time. But for Indians, the traditional and cultural chord is so strong that no matter where the siblings are, they will try to wear traditional Indian clothes that reflect our values, tradition and culture. On the occasion of Rakhi, special dishes are prepared, which includes sweets and namkeens. The day has a deeper perspective in today's scenario. The rakhi tying ritual has become so much a part of the families that come what may brothers and sisters try to reach out to each other on this particular day bringing back the oneness of the family, binding the family together in an emotional bond.
