The number of temples dedicated to Sri Krishna is few. The reason being that people have taken to worship him through paintings and not through temple images. The Rajagopalaswami temple in Mannargudi in the Tiruvarur district, BalaKrishna temple at Udupi, Krishna temple at Guruvayur and Pandavadhoothar temple in Kanchivaram are dedicated to the memory of Vishnu's incarnation as Sri Krishna. In these places this day is celebrated with great grandeur and devotion.
